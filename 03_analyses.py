        st.markdown("""In our search for the **Higgs boson**, we rely on applying **cuts** to help reveal its unique characteristics amidst a large amount of data. One of the ways we do this is by focusing on a variable called **transverse momentum** (p$_T$), which represents the momentum of particles perpendicular to the beamline.

Each lepton in our data has a p$_T$ value, which we‚Äôve recorded in descending order as **leading** (highest p$_T$), **sub-leading**, and so forth. By examining these values, we can apply cuts to keep data that better resembles the Higgs boson's characteristics, while reducing data less likely to contain it.

One approach to isolating the Higgs is to apply cuts that remove regions where the **background** (data not related to the Higgs) tends to dominate, leaving more events that match our Higgs-like signature. This means setting a lower limit on the p$_T$ for leptons, as higher p$_T$ values are more likely to capture the events we‚Äôre interested in.

The plots below show the p$_T$ distributions for the first, second, and third leptons in both signal (Higgs) and background data. Applying cuts to the lower p$_T$ values could help reduce the background and improve the visibility of potential Higgs events.

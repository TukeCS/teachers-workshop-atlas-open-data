# Printables
The Printables section offers a diverse collection of ready-to-use classroom materials designed to enhance lessons on particle physics. We provide comprehensive cheat sheets that summarize key concepts, formulas, and termsâ€”serving as quick reference guides to support students of all ages in their learning journey. These cheat sheets are ideal for reinforcing understanding and aiding revision.

In addition, we offer engaging colouring books and activities that introduce fundamental ideas through fun visuals, catering especially to younger students. These resources make particle physics concepts accessible and spark curiosity in young minds.

## Colouring Books and Activities
Designed with younger students in mind, this section offers fun and engaging colouring books and activities that introduce the basics of particle physics. These resources make learning about science enjoyable and accessible, sparking curiosity and creativity in young minds.

#### The Standard Model
All fundamental particles classified based on their properties! Deviations to the Standard Model can point the way to new physics.

#### Conservation Laws
These laws govern the reactions we observe in particle physics! Their violation would be a sign of new physics.

#### Statistical Significance
When physicists make statements about whether or not a given process has been observed in the LHC data, they must back up their claim with strong statistical evidence. This is often expressed in terms of standard deviations or the p-value.

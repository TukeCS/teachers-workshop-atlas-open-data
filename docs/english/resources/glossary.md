# Glossary

- **Luminosity**: Measures the concentration of particles in a given space, such as the proton beam at the LHC. Higher luminosity means a higher probability that particles will collide and give rise to a desired interaction. This can be achieved by packing more particles into the beam, or by focusing the beam more tightly.

- **Invariant mass**: When a particle decays, its mass before decay can be calculated from the energies and momenta of the decay products. The value obtained for the mass is independent of the reference frame in which the energies and momenta are measured, so the mass is called "invariant". The concept is often generalized so that for any set of particles (for example, two leptons emerging from a collision), the same formulas can be applied to obtain an "invariant mass" of the set.

- **Background**: When looking for evidence of new physics, we compare what we observe to what theories predict we will observe. The background is the set of results that scientists expect to see. If more instances of a certain type of event *(see "Excess")* are observed in an experiment than are expected to be seen as part of the background, this could be evidence of new physics.

- **Excess**: When scientists see more instances of a data graph than expected, they call these excesses. Scientists measure the statistical significance *(see "Standard Deviation")* of the excesses to determine how confident they are that they are the result of new physics and not just random fluctuations.

- **Standard Deviation**: A standard deviation is a measure of how unusual a set of data is if a hypothesis is true. Physicists express standard deviations in units called sigma, Ïƒ. The higher the sigma number, the more inconsistent the data are with the hypothesis.

## Let's ensure conservation
In particle interactions, [certain properties are always conserved](https://cds.cern.ch/record/2759491/files/Conservation%20Laws%20-%20ATLAS%20Physics%20Cheat%20Sheet.pdf), such as *charge* and lepton *flavor*. Understanding these conservation laws helps narrow down the possibilities for what particles are involved in the final state.

In your analysis, you can look at the flavor of the leptons (whether they are electrons or muons) and their charge (positive or negative). The particles with opposite charge are called antiparticles, a positive electron is called positron and a positive muon is called anti-muon. The plot below shows the distribution of lepton flavors, with one bar for positively charged and one for negatively charged leptons. This helps identify whether the final state obeys conservation laws.

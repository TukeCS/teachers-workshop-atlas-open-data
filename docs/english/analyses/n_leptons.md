## Number of Leptons in the Final State
When particles are produced in a particle collider, they often decay immediately into other particles. These decay products are what we detect and analyze. By studying the particles in the final state (those visible after all decays), we can infer which particles were originally created in the collision.

To understand this better, letâ€™s take a look at [Feynman diagrams](https://cds.cern.ch/record/2759490/files/Feynman%20Diagrams%20-%20ATLAS%20Cheat%20Sheet.pdf). These diagrams help visualize particle interactions. In the examples below, we are reading the diagrams **from left to right**: the particles on the left are produced in the collision, and the particles on the right are the final decay products that we detect.

Here is a diagram showing a Z boson decaying into two leptons (either electrons or muons):

More complex processes, such as Higgs boson decays, can result in more leptons in the final state. For example, here is a Higgs boson decaying into two Z bosons, each of which decays further into two leptons:

In many processes, particles are produced in pairs due to the nature of particle interactions. For example, the Z boson decays symmetrically into two leptons because it interacts equally with matter and antimatter. Similarly, the Higgs boson produces multiple leptons when its decay involves intermediate particles like Z bosons, which themselves decay into lepton pairs.

The dataset you are analyzing contains events with varying numbers of leptons. Below is a plot showing the distribution of lepton counts in the entire dataset. Events with fewer leptons are more common because simpler processes, like those involving W or Z bosons, occur more frequently than rarer, complex ones like Higgs boson decays.

Study the Feynman diagrams and the data above. Depending on whether you're focusing on finding the Z boson or the Higgs boson, select the number of leptons you expect to observe in your final state.

> [!CAUTION] 
When selecting the number of leptons, additional criteria are applied to ensure the quality of the data. Leptons must be well-separated from other particles (**isolated**) and **accurately identified** as electrons or muons. Since particles can sometimes be misidentified, we use identification levels to measure how confident we are in their type. Additionally, only events with signals strong enough to activate the detector's selection system (called triggers), specifically for identifying electrons or muons, are included.

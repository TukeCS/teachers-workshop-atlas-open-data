## Step 1: Select Events by Number of Particle

To begin our analysis, we will **filter the dataset step by step**. In this first step, you'll focus on events based on the **number of particles** detected. By selecting one or more values from the options below (2, 3, or 4), you are filtering the events that match your selection in the `nParticles` column of the dataset.

The dataset displayed below will **update dynamically** to reflect your selection. This allows you to see how the filtered events correspond to events with the selected number of particles, giving you an immediate visual understanding of the effect of your choices.

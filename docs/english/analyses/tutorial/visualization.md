## Visualization of Final Dataset
The plot below shows the energy distribution of the events remaining after applying all your selected cuts. The x-axis reflects the energy range you chose in the previous step, and the distribution will dynamically update as you modify any of the prior selections (number of particles, lepton type, or energy range).

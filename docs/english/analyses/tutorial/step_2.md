The filtered dataset contains {filtered_data_size} events. The table below shows only the events matching your selection.

## Step 2: Select Events by Lepton Type
Now that you've filtered the events by the number of particles, it's time to narrow down the selection further based on the **type of lepton** detected in each event. In this case, leptons can be either **electrons** or **muons**, and each type plays a different role in particle physics analyses. By selecting one or both lepton types from the options below, you are telling the app to include only the events where the **LeptonType** column matches your choice. The table below updates dynamically to reflect your selection.

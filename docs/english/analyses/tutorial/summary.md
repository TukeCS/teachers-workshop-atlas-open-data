> [!NOTE]
It's important to note that this plot is **illustrative** and meant to help you see how the cuts shape your dataset. At this  stage, you are not expected to derive any specific insights or interpret meaningful results from this visualizationâ€”its purpose is purely to showcase the impact of your filters.

### Summary
- You started with a dataset of 500 events.
- By applying cuts, you reduced the dataset to a smaller subset focused on meaningful events.
- You vizualized the distribution of the energy of the reduced dataset.
    
If everything is clear, in the next step you can use similar filteres on real events to identify specific particles, such as the Z boson or Higgs boson. Happy analyzing!

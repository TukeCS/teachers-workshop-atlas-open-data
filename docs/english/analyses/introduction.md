# Discover the Z and the Higgs Bosons by Yourself!
 With this interactive app you can discover the Z and the Higgs bosons. By understanding and making a selection of events you will discover the particles yourself!

## How much data do you want to use?
Begin your analysis by choosing how much data you'd like to work with. Use the slider below to select the **integrated luminosity**, which is a measure of how much data the ATLAS detector has collected.

The more data you analyze, the better chance you have of spotting rare events like the Higgs boson! But keep in mind, *more data can also mean more processing time*.

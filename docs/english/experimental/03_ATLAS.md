# The ATLAS Experiment
The ATLAS detector at CERN is designed to observe the products of particle collisions in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Standing at 25 meters tall and 46 meters long, it consists of multiple layers, each serving a specific purpose in detecting particles produced during high-energy collisions. The layers are arranged like the rings of an onion, each capturing different types of particles and measuring unique properties.

## Layers of the ATLAS Detector
Below is an illustration of the ATLAS detectorâ€™s layered structure and how various particles appear as they travel through each section:

### Inner Detector
Located closest to the collision point, the Inner Detector tracks the paths of charged particles. A magnetic field causes charged particles to follow curved paths, and the degree of curvature helps determine their momentum and charge. The Inner Detector is used for for identifying particles like electrons, positrons, and charged hadrons.

### Electromagnetic Calorimeter
The next layer is the Electromagnetic Calorimeter, which measures the energy of particles that interact electromagnetically, such as electrons and photons. When these particles enter the calorimeter, they produce a shower of secondary particles that deposit energy in the detector, allowing the calorimeter to measure their total energy.

### Hadronic Calorimeter
Beyond the electromagnetic calorimeter lies the Hadronic Calorimeter, which measures the energy of particles that interact through the strong nuclear force, such as protons, neutrons, and other hadrons. This layer captures energy by absorbing the hadrons and creating a cascade of particles that the detector can measure.

### Muon Spectrometer
The outermost layer of the ATLAS detector, the Muon Spectrometer, is specifically designed to detect muons. Unlike other particles, muons can pass through the inner detector layers and the calorimeters without losing much energy. This layer allows ATLAS to track muons accurately.

## Particle Signals in ATLAS
Different particles leave distinct signals as they move through the ATLAS detector as shown in image 1:

- *Electrons and Photons* produce electromagnetic showers in the **Electromagnetic Calorimeter**.
- *Hadrons* such as protons and neutrons deposit energy in the **Hadronic Calorimeter**.
- *Muons* pass through all inner layers with minimal energy loss and are captured in the **Muon Spectrometer**.
- *Neutrinos*, which rarely interact with matter, typically leave no direct trace but can be inferred from missing energy in the detector.

Each of these components works together to capture the properties of particles and allow reconstruction of the details of particle interactions in collisions.

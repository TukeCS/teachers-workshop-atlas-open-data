# Experimental Particle Physics
In this section, we’ll explore the tools and techniques that allow scientists to study the most fundamental building blocks of the universe. While the Foundations of Particle Physics module introduced the theory behind particles and forces, this module focuses on how we actually observe and experiment with these particles.

Modern particle physics experiments rely on two major components: particle **accelerators** and **detectors**. Accelerators provide the immense energy needed to create and study new particles, while detectors allow us to observe the results of these high-energy collisions.

#### Tabs:
1. **Accelerating Particles**: Particle accelerators, such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), speed up particles to nearly the speed of light and smash them together. This tab will cover how these accelerators work, why we use them, and what kinds of discoveries we can make by recreating the conditions of the early universe.
2. **Detecting Particles**: Once particles are accelerated and collide, detectors come into play. Detectors like ATLAS capture the products of these collisions, allowing us to study particles that existed only fractions of a second after the Big Bang. In this tab, we’ll explore how detectors are designed to measure the paths, energy, and interactions of particles.

Together, accelerators and detectors form the backbone of experimental particle physics, helping us push the boundaries of our knowledge and test the predictions of the Standard Model.

# Experimental Particle Physics
In this section, we’ll explore the tools and techniques that allow studying the most fundamental building blocks of the universe. While the Foundations of Particle Physics module introduced the theory behind particles and forces, this module focuses on how we actually observe and experiment with these particles.

Modern particle physics experiments rely on two major components: particle **accelerators** and **detectors**. Accelerators provide the immense energy needed to collide particles, while detectors allow us to observe and study the results of these high-energy collisions.

#### Tabs:
1. **Accelerating Particles**: Particle accelerators, like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), speed up particles to nearly the speed of light before colliding them. This tab explains the mechanics of particle accelerators, the reasons we use them in particle physics, and the groundbreaking discoveries made by recreating conditions similar to those of the early universe.
2. **Detecting Particles**: Detectors capture and analyze particles from high-energy collisions, revealing their paths, energy, and interactions. This tab explores how detectors like ATLAS help us study particles that are otherwise invisible.
3. **The ATLAS Experiment**: ATLAS, a multi-layered detector at CERN’s LHC, observes particles from collisions, with each layer designed to capture unique properties. This tab details how ATLAS detects these events to expand our knowledge of the particle world.

Together, accelerators and detectors form the backbone of experimental particle physics, helping us push the boundaries of our knowledge and test the predictions of the Standard Model.

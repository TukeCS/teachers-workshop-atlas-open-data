# Detecting particles
In particle physics, detectors are the instruments that allow observing and studying the behavior of subatomic particles produced in high-energy collisions. These detectors are specialized devices, capable of measuring various properties of particles such as their energy, momentum, and charge. By capturing, reconstructing and analyzing this data, we can infer the presence of particles that are otherwise invisible, contributing to our understanding of the building blocks of matter and the forces governing their interactions.

Detectors are designed in layers, with each layer specialized to detect different particles or measure specific characteristics. The primary components include:

- **Tracking Systems**: These record the paths of charged particles, enabling the reconstruction of their trajectories and identification of the type of particle based on its path curvature in a magnetic field.
- **Calorimeters**: Calorimeters measure a particleâ€™s energy by absorbing it. There are two main types: electromagnetic calorimeters, which measure particles like electrons and photons, and hadronic calorimeters, which measure heavier particles like protons and neutrons.
- **Muon Systems**: Since muons can penetrate through most detector layers without being absorbed, the muon system is positioned at the outermost layer. It detects muons specifically, providing data for identifying these particles and obtaining their paths.

## Experiments Using Particle Detectors
Many experiments around the world use particle detectors to explore the fundamental components of matter and the forces governing their interactions:

- **ATLAS and CMS (CERN)**: These detectors are part of the LHC and are among the most powerful in the world. They were key in the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012, which was a groundbreaking confirmation of the Standard Model.
- **DUNE (Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment)**: Located in the United States, DUNE focuses on studying neutrinos, mysterious particles that rarely interact with matter. Its detector is located underground to reduce interference from other particles.
- **Belle II (KEK, Japan)**: This experiment studies the differences between matter and antimatter by observing particles produced in electron-positron collisions. Its detector captures the decay of [B mesons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_meson) to understand why the universe has more matter than antimatter.

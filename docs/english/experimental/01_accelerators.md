# Accelerating Particles
In experimental particle physics, research is performed by accelerating particles and colliding them either with other particles or with solid targets. This is done with *particle accelerators*  and the collisions are examined with *particle detectors*.

The world's largest particle accelerator, the **Large Hadron Collider (LHC)**, is located at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research. The LHC is a 27-kilometer-long circular [synchrotron accelerator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchrotron). The LHC is located in a tunnel 100 meters underground on the border of France and Switzerland (Image 1).   

In 2012, the ATLAS and CMS experiments at CERN announced that they had observed a new particle with a mass equal to the predicted mass of the Higgs boson. The Higgs boson and the Higgs field related to it explain the origin of the mass of particles. In 2013, Peter Higgs and François Englert, who predicted the Higgs boson theoretically, were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics.

The LHC mainly accelerates and collides **protons**. The proton source of the LHC is a bottle of hydrogen. Protons are produced by stripping the electrons away from the hydrogen atoms with the help of an electric field.

The process of accelerating the protons starts before the LHC. Before the protons arrive in the LHC, they are accelerated with electric fields and directed with magnetic fields in smaller accelerators (Linac 2, Proton  Synchrotron Booster, Proton Synchrotron, and Super Proton Synchrotron). After these, the protons have an energy of 450 GeV. The protons are injected into the LHC in two different beam pipes; each beam contains 2,808 proton bunches located about 7.5 meters from each other. Each of these bunches includes $1.2 \times 10^{11}$ protons.

The two beams circulate in opposite directions in two different vacuum tubes. Image 2 shows a part of the LHC accelerator opened with the two vacuum tubes visible inside. Each of the proton beams will reach the energy of about 7 TeV (7,000 GeV) in the LHC.

Particle collisions are created by crossing these two beams that are heading in opposite directions. Because the bunches are traveling so fast, there will be about 40 million bunch crossings per second in the LHC. When two proton bunches cross, not all of the protons collide with each other. Only about 40 protons per bunch will collide and so create about 20 collisions. That means there will be 800 million proton collisions every second in the LHC. That's a lot of action!

The maximum energy of these collisions is 14 TeV. However, in most cases, the collision energy is smaller than that because when protons collide, it is really their constituents—the quarks and gluons—which collide with each other. So not all of the energy of the protons is transmitted to the collision.

When the protons collide, the energy of the collision can be transformed into mass $E=mc^2$, and new particles are produced in the collisions. These new particles are ejected from the collision area, a bit like a small explosion. By examining and measuring the particles created in collisions, researchers try to understand better the known particles which make up our universe and search for new particles which could explain puzzles such as dark matter.
            
The acceleration and collision processes are summarized well in the short video below. Watch the video from the start until 1:15 to get a picture of these processes.

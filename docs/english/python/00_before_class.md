# Learn Python basics for HEP

This section is designed to help you get familiar with some basic tools that will make the hands-on part of the workshop easier to follow. If you’re new to coding or need a refresher, we’ve included two key topics:

### Tabs
1. **Python Basics**: This tab will introduce you to the fundamentals of Python, the programming language we'll be using for data analysis. You’ll learn about basic syntax, variables, and functions, so you can navigate through the analysis with confidence.

2. **Introduction to Histogramming**: Here, you’ll find an explanation of how histograms work, including how to create and interpret them. Since histograms are one of the most common ways we visualize data in particle physics, this will be a useful tool throughout the hands-on sessions.

> [!CAUTION] 
Remember, this section is entirely optional. The workshop is designed so that you can follow along even if you don’t go through this material. However, if you feel like brushing up on these skills before diving into the analysis, this is a great place to start!

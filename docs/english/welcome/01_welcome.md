# Welcome to the ATLAS Open Data Teachers Workshop!

This workshop is designed to introduce you to the exciting world of particle physics through ATLAS Open Data. Throughout the workshop, we’ll explore the fundamental theories of particle physics, dive into the mechanics of experimental particle detection, and conclude with hands-on analysis using real ATLAS data.

## Workshop Roadmap:
1. **Before Class (Optional)**
If you're new to coding, we've prepared a brief introduction to Python and how to plot histograms. This material is here to help you get comfortable with the basics, but don’t worry—this isn't mandatory! The hands-on sessions are designed to work whether or not you've gone through this section.

2. **Foundations of Particle Physics**
Our first talk will introduce the core concepts of particle physics. You'll learn about the Standard Model, the building blocks of matter, and how these particles interact in the universe.

3. **Experimental Particle Physics**
Next, we’ll shift our focus to the real-world tools that allow us to study these particles. This talk covers particle accelerators and detectors, with a special emphasis on how the ATLAS detector captures and records data from high-energy collisions.

4. **Hands-on Analysis**
After the theoretical foundations are set, it’s time to apply what you’ve learned! You’ll be guided through real data analysis exercises, including:

- Z Peak Analysis – Discover how to identify the Z boson.
- Higgs to ZZ – Delve into the decay of the Higgs boson into two Z bosons.
- Higgs to Two Photons (Bonus) – Explore a further analysis on this important Higgs decay channel.

We hope this workshop empowers you to not only understand particle physics but also to bring this knowledge back to your classrooms and inspire the next generation of scientists!

# ATLAS Open Data in the Classroom

![](https://atlas.cern/sites/default/files/2024-07/ATLAS-open-data.jpg)

**Welcome** to ATLAS Open Data in the Classroom! We’re thrilled to have you join us in exploring the fascinating world of particle physics. Through this workshop, we’ll guide you on a journey to discover a particle – are you ready to find the Higgs boson? Along the way, you’ll gain a understanding of particle physics concepts, the "what," "why," and "how" of this field. This workshop also serves as an introduction to [ATLAS Open Data](http://opendata.atlas.cern/), with resources available for further exploration if you’re eager to learn more.

### Roadmap
> [!NOTE]
#### 1. **Foundations of Particle Physics**
Our first task will be to introduce you to the core concepts of particle physics. Here, you’ll learn what we mean by "particles," explore the Standard Model, understand the building blocks of matter, and see how particles interact in the universe. There’s also a special focus on the Higgs boson – the star of this workshop!

#### 2. **Experimental Particle Physics**
Next, we’ll shift to the experimental tools that enable us to study particles. This section covers particle accelerators and detectors, highlighting how the ATLAS detector captures and records data from high-energy collisions.

#### 3. **Hands-on Analysis**
After the theoretical foundations are set, it’s time to apply what you’ve learned! You’ll be guided through real data analysis exercises, including:

- Z Peak Analysis – Learn how to identify the Z boson.
- Higgs to ZZ –  Explore the decay of the Higgs boson into two Z bosons.

This part is where you get to use the public data collected by the ATLAS detector!

#### 4. **Intro to Python**
If you're new to coding, we've prepared a brief introduction to Python and histogram plotting. This material is here to help you get comfortable with the basics, but don’t worry — this isn't mandatory!

> [!NOTE]
#### 5. **Classroom Toolkit**
To support you in using this material, we’ve compiled a toolkit of resources that complement the workshop and enhance your classroom learning experience.

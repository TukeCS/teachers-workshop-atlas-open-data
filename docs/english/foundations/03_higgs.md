# The Higgs Boson
The Higgs boson is a fundamental particle that plays a crucial role in giving mass to other particles. Discovered in 2012 by the ATLAS and CMS experiments at CERN’s Large Hadron Collider (LHC), its existence confirmed a vital part of the Standard Model. But what exactly makes it so important?

## The Higgs Field and Mass
To understand the Higgs boson, we first need to introduce the Higgs field. Imagine the Higgs field as an invisible energy field that fills the entire universe, similar to how water fills an ocean. Particles interact with this field as they move through it, and this interaction slows them down, giving them mass. The stronger a particle’s interaction with the Higgs field, the more mass it gains. Some particles, like photons, don’t interact with the Higgs field at all, which is why they remain massless and can travel at the speed of light.

The Higgs boson is the particle associated to this field, a manifestation that confirms the field’s existence. It’s similar to a ripple in the water – just as a ripple indicates the presence of water, the Higgs boson reveals the Higgs field.

## Why the Higgs Boson Matters
The Higgs boson is important for a few reasons:
- **Completing the Standard Model**: The Higgs boson was the last missing particle of the Standard Model, providing the final confirmation that our theoretical framework is correct.
- **Explaining Mass**: Without the Higgs field, particles like quarks and electrons would be massless, and atoms as we know them couldn’t form. This field explains why matter has substance and why our universe has structure.
- **Opening Doors Beyond the Standard Model**: While it completes the Standard Model, the Higgs boson also raises questions about physics beyond this theory, such as the nature of dark matter, which doesn’t seem to interact with the Higgs field, and the origin of dark energy.

## Detecting the Higgs Boson
Detecting the Higgs boson is no easy feat. It has a very short lifetime, decaying into other particles almost immediately after it’s produced. At ATLAS we were able to identify it by looking for these decay products, particularly in **Higgs to two Z bosons** and **Higgs to two photons decays**. Observing these specific decay patterns allowed us to recognize the “fingerprint” of the Higgs boson.

# What We Don’t Know Yet
While the Standard Model of particle physics has been incredibly successful in explaining much of what we observe in the universe, there are still significant gaps in our understanding. Some phenomena can’t yet be explained by the particles and forces described in the Standard Model, leaving scientists with exciting mysteries to solve. Here are some of the biggest unknowns in particle physics:

## Dark Matter:
One of the greatest mysteries in modern physics is dark matter. Observations of galaxies and cosmic structures show that the majority of matter in the universe is "invisible"—it doesn’t emit, absorb, or reflect light, yet its gravitational effects are evident. This unseen substance is called dark matter. Despite indirect evidence, scientists have not yet identified what particles make up dark matter, and it does not seem to fit into the Standard Model. Many experiments are underway to try to detect these elusive particles.

## Dark Energy:
Even more mysterious than dark matter is dark energy, an unknown force driving the accelerated expansion of the universe. While dark matter accounts for about 27% of the universe’s energy content, dark energy makes up nearly 68%. It’s responsible for the increasing speed at which galaxies are moving away from each other, but its nature remains a complete mystery. Understanding dark energy is one of the biggest challenges in cosmology and particle physics.

## Gravity and the Graviton:
While the Standard Model explains three of the four fundamental forces—electromagnetism, the weak force, and the strong force—it does not account for gravity. In theory, gravity should be mediated by a particle called the graviton, but we have not yet observed this particle, and gravity doesn’t fit neatly into the framework of the Standard Model. Unifying gravity with the other forces of nature remains one of the most significant unsolved problems in physics.

## Matter-Antimatter Asymmetry:
The matter-antimatter asymmetry problem is another unresolved question. According to the Standard Model, the Big Bang should have created equal amounts of matter and antimatter. However, our universe is made almost entirely of matter, with very little antimatter observed. What caused this imbalance? Scientists are investigating various possibilities, including whether there are unknown interactions that favor matter over antimatter.

## Neutrino Mass and Behavior:
Neutrinos are some of the lightest and most elusive particles in the universe, and there is still much we don’t know about them. For example, while we know neutrinos have mass, the Standard Model doesn’t predict how they get it or why their masses are so small. Additionally, neutrinos have the peculiar ability to change from one type (or "flavor") to another—a process known as neutrino oscillation—but the full nature of these oscillations is still being explored.

## New Physics Beyond the Standard Model:
Many physicists believe that there is new physics beyond the Standard Model, waiting to be discovered. Whether it’s through the discovery of new particles, unknown forces, or the resolution of dark matter and dark energy, the future of particle physics is filled with potential breakthroughs. The Large Hadron Collider and other experiments are constantly pushing the boundaries of what we know, searching for clues to solve these great mysteries.

These unknowns represent some of the most exciting frontiers in physics today, and solving them will likely require new ideas, experiments, and theories that go beyond the Standard Model. While we've learned a lot about the universe, there is still so much more to discover.

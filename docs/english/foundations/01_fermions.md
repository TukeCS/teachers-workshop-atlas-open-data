# The Building Blocks of Matter (Fermions)

Fermions are the particles that make up all the matter in the universe. In the Standard Model, these are divided into two main families: **quarks** and **leptons**.

## Quarks
Quarks are never found in isolation; instead, they group together to form larger particles like protons and neutrons, which make up the atomic nucleus. There are six types (or “flavors”) of quarks: up, down, charm, strange, top, and bottom. The up and down quarks are the most common and make up protons (two up quarks, one down) and neutrons (two down quarks, one up).

The other quark flavors—charm, strange, top, and bottom—are heavier and appear only in high-energy environments, such as in particle accelerators like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).

## Leptons
Leptons are the other half of the matter family. Unlike quarks, leptons can exist on their own and are not confined within larger particles. The most familiar lepton is the electron, which orbits the nucleus of atoms. Along with the electron, there are two heavier charged leptons: the muon and the tau, both of which are unstable and decay quickly after being created in high-energy processes.

Each charged lepton also has a neutral partner called a neutrino. Neutrinos are incredibly light and interact very weakly with matter, making them difficult to detect. There are three types of neutrinos, one for each charged lepton: the electron neutrino, the muon neutrino, and the tau neutrino.

## Fermions and the Universe
Fermions follow the Pauli Exclusion Principle, meaning no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. This property is what gives matter its structure, preventing everything from collapsing into a dense, single point.

Together, quarks and leptons form the foundation of all visible matter, from the atoms in our bodies to the stars in the sky. But fermions are just one part of the story—next, we’ll explore the forces that act between them, which are mediated by bosons.

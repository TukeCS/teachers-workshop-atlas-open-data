# What We Don’t Know Yet
While the Standard Model provides a powerful framework, several fundamental mysteries remain. This tab explores some of these open questions and the ongoing scientific efforts to address them:

- **Dark Matter**: Observational evidence suggests that up to 85% of the universe's matter is invisible and doesn’t emit or interact with light in ways we can detect. Known as dark matter, this mysterious substance doesn’t fit into the Standard Model, which only describes ordinary, visible matter. Physicists are actively searching for new particles, such as WIMPs ([Weakly Interacting Massive Particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weakly_interacting_massive_particle)), that might explain this hidden mass. Efforts range from underground detectors shielded from background radiation to large collider experiments seeking traces of dark matter interactions.
- **Dark Energy**: Not only is the universe expanding, but this expansion is accelerating, driven by a force known as dark energy. This force accounts for approximately 70% of the universe, yet it remains one of the least understood phenomena in cosmology. Dark energy isn’t part of the Standard Model, and scientists are exploring theories like quintessence or modifications to general relativity to explain it. New experiments and space observatories, like the [Euclid mission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid_(spacecraft)), are aiming to study dark energy’s effects on cosmic expansion.
- **Gravity**: Gravity is the only fundamental force not included in the Standard Model. While the other forces—electromagnetic, weak, and strong—are described at the quantum level, gravity is currently only explained by [Einstein’s general theory of relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity). A unified “Theory of Everything” would integrate gravity with quantum mechanics, potentially through theories like [string theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory) or [quantum gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_gravity). This challenge continues to push both experimental and theoretical work.
- **Matter-Antimatter Asymmetry**: The Big Bang should have produced equal amounts of matter and antimatter, which would theoretically annihilate each other, leaving a universe filled only with energy. Yet, we observe a universe dominated by matter. This imbalance, called the *baryon asymmetry*, suggests some unknown process caused matter to slightly outnumber antimatter. Experiments in particle accelerators aim to observe behaviors that could explain this mystery, such as slight differences in the way particles and their antimatter counterparts decay.
- **Neutrino Properties**: Neutrinos are particles with almost no mass and barely interact with other matter, which makes them difficult to study. Recent discoveries suggest they may have unique properties beyond what the Standard Model predicts, including the possibility of new types of neutrinos or interactions. Research into these “ghost particles” could provide clues to new physics.

Scientists are using advanced detectors, particle accelerators, and cosmic observatories to investigate these mysteries. By exploring physics beyond the Standard Model, we hope to expand our understanding of the universe in ways that could reshape fundamental science.

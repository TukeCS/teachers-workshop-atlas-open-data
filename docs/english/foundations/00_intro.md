# Foundations of Particle Physics

Welcome to the Foundations of Particle Physics section! This is where we introduce you to the fundamental ideas behind particle physics, focusing on the Standard Model (SM), which describes how everything in the universe is built from a few elementary particles. These particles fall into two main categories: fermions, which make up matter, and bosons, which mediate forces between particles.

#### Tabs:
1. **The Building Blocks of Matter (Fermions)**: In this tab, we’ll explore fermions—particles that form all matter in the universe. These include quarks and leptons, the particles that combine to form protons, neutrons, electrons, and other fundamental building blocks of matter.

2. **The Forces of Nature (Bosons)**: Here, we’ll look at bosons, the particles responsible for mediating forces between fermions. These include the photon (responsible for electromagnetism), the W and Z bosons (weak force), and the gluon (strong force), as well as the famous Higgs boson, which gives mass to particles.

3. **What We Don’t Know Yet**: While the Standard Model explains a lot, there are still many unanswered questions. This tab will discuss some of the big mysteries, such as dark matter, dark energy, and why gravity doesn’t fit into the Standard Model. We’ll also touch on what scientists are currently doing to expand our understanding of these unknowns.

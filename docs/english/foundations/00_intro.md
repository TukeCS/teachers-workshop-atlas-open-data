# Foundations of Particle Physics
This section introduces key ideas in particle physics, centering on the Standard Model (SM), which explains how fundamental particles and forces shape our universe. The SM organizes particles into fermions (building blocks of matter) and bosons (force carriers).

#### Tabs:
1. **What are particles?**:  Here, we clarify what physicists mean by “particles” in particle physics, setting the stage for understanding the fundamental components of matter and forces.

2. **The Standard Model**: arranges fermions and bosons, which mediate forces like electromagnetism, the weak force, and the strong force. This tab covers how fundamental particles are classified and how they interact.

3. **Higgs boson**: Essential to the SM, the Higgs boson provides mass to particles via the Higgs field. Here, we’ll explore why its discovery was groundbreaking.

4. **What We Don’t Know**: While powerful, the Standard Model doesn’t explain everything. This tab touches on open questions like dark matter, dark energy, and gravity, and ongoing research that aims to answer these questions.
